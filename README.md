# Tokyo_Olympic_ADE_Project

**Tokyo Olympic Azure Data Engineering Project**

Developed an end-to-end data pipeline for processing Tokyo Olympic data using a suite of Azure cloud services. The project involved:

- **Data Ingestion:** Automated the ingestion of five CSV files (Athletes, Medals, Coaches, Teams, and EntriesGender) from GitHub into the raw zone of Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) using Azure Data Factory (ADF) copy activities.
- **Data Transformation:** Leveraged Azure Databricks notebooks to apply data cleansing and business logic transformations. Processed data was then stored in the curated zone of ADLS, ensuring enhanced data quality and readiness for analysis.
- **Data Integration & Analytics:** Connected the curated data to Azure Synapse Analytics, where a lake database and corresponding tables were created. This integration enabled efficient querying and high-performance analytics for downstream reporting and insights.

*Key Skills & Technologies:* Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, ETL Processes, Data Pipeline Automation, Cloud Data Architecture.

This project highlights my capability to design and implement scalable data solutions in a cloud environment, showcasing proficiency in data ingestion, transformation, and integration for advanced analytics.
